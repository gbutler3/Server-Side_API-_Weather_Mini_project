# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## Goals

- Users are presented with current and future conditions for a searched city and that city is added to the search history
- Users can view current weather conditions for the searched city, and are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- The UV index, presents users with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- Users can view future weather conditions for that city, with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- In the search history, users are able to click on a city and are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
